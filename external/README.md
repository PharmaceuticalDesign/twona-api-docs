# External

External tools allow a two-way communication channel with people outside of your organisation (thus, non users). For now we support two use cases: transfering files and requesting feedback and approvals.

- [Request Feedback/Approval](feedbacks.md): this feature allows the users to request feedback in the form of notes on files, comments and file upload, aswell as formal approval/rejections with specific reasons. You can specify a collection of email addresses to which an email requesting the feedback will be sent along with a link to provide such feedback.
- [Transfer Files](transfer.md): this feature is a simple file transfer model that allows the transfer of one or multiple (large) files through email with a download link model. You can specify a collection of email addresses to which an email will be sent containing a download link to those files.
